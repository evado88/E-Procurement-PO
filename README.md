# E-Proucurement Purchase Order Template

You can use this project to update the purchase order report. The project is already linked to the relevant database and has correct fields.

The project is a plain ASP.NET Web Applicaion (.NET Framework) projet that can be created in Visual Studio 2017 and later.  The only dependancy addded is DevExpress because it uses their report.

The idea is to create a report that matches the design of the actual purchase order report that is used by CIDRZ. This template is available here http://192.168.50.11:88/POHS11213010545.pdf

You can open the report under the Reports folder in the project and update and preview its design within Visual Studio itself.
